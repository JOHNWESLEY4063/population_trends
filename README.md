🌍📈 Population Dynamics & Socio-Economic Indicators Analysis
A machine learning project to analyze global population trends and their correlation with various socio-economic factors.
🌟 Key Features
Multi-Country Data Integration: Combines datasets from several countries for a holistic view.
Comprehensive Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, and feature engineering.
In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes correlations, trends, and patterns using heatmaps and statistical summaries.
Machine Learning Predictions: Employs various regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict key indicators.
Performance Evaluation: Uses RMSE and R2 metrics to assess model accuracy.
Population Projections: Provides insights into historical growth rates and future population estimates.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Seaborn (for statistical data visualization)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models and preprocessing)
🚀 How to Run the Project
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab (recommended for interactive exploration)
The following Python libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

└── IDS_PROJECT (1).ipynb  # The Jupyter Notebook containing the project code


Note: Ensure the country-specific CSV files (e.g., India.csv, Canada.csv) are present in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook for the load_data function to work correctly.
Steps to Run
Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the files:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>


Ensure all .csv data files are in the same directory as the IDS_PROJECT (1).ipynb notebook.
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook "IDS_PROJECT (1).ipynb"

This will open the notebook in your web browser.
Run all cells: Go to Cell -> Run All in the Jupyter interface. The notebook will execute step-by-step, performing data loading, analysis, model training, and displaying outputs and visualizations.
📊 Example Output
The notebook will generate various outputs, including:
Head of the combined DataFrame.
Basic information (df.info()) and descriptive statistics (df.describe()).
Missing value counts for each column.
A correlation matrix heatmap of key indicators (e.g., Birth Rate, Death Rate, GDP, Employment).
Printed population trend analysis and projections for various countries.
Model evaluation metrics (RMSE, R2) for different regression algorithms.
